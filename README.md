An ALTER EGO fangame, on how Commander ended up in Ego's Labyrinth. This repo contains a a copy of demo 1 of the game.

This repo DOES NOT contain any copyrighted assets, meaning it will definitely be broken if ran as is, provide your own assets if you want to run it, this repo is like a game engine.

Code will be messy as it may contain deadcode since the game was overhauled multiple times.
